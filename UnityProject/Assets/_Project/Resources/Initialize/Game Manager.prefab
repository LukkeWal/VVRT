      description: 'Welcome to the Ray Casting level of the Virtual Ray Tracer! This
        level is dedicated to the art of visualizing 3D scalar data. Simply follow
        this tutorial to learn how ray casting works and how to use this tool.

        turn out. You can disable it by scrolling to the bottom of the menu on the
        right and ticking the "Show preview" Box.

      name: Voxel Grids
      description: For ray casting to work we first need a 3D volume with scalar
        data (a scalar is a single number). These scalar values usually represent
        densities. We represent this data as a 3D grid with x, y and z axis where
        every position is a number between 0 and 1. This reprensentation is called
        a Voxel Grid.

      description: We have a few pre-made voxel grids for you. You can pick which
        one you want to visualize on the right. We have bucky, bunny, engine, and
        hazelnut. Currently engine is selected. Try changing it to something else
        using the dropdown menu on the right under the "Ray Caster" tab.

      name: Getting a sample
      description: 'Now that we have our voxel grid we can shoot a ray through it.
        This ray will collect samples as it passes through the grid.

        Usually
        these samples do not land exactly on a single voxel. Instead we take the
        8 voxels close to it, forming a cube around the sample, then use trilinear
        interpolation.

        is done by editing the distance between these samples with the slider on
        the right. \nTry editing the distance between samples.\nNote that very low

      name: Setting the Color Lookup Table 1
      description: The samples collected along our ray need to be translated to a
        color. This is done using the Transfer function. We take the 2 densities
        below and above our sample from the transfer table.  To do this efficiently
        all densities in the transfer function must be in ascending order. Try editing
        a density.

    - identifier: changeColor
      name: Setting the Color Lookup Table 2
      description: Using the 2 densities from the transfer table we use linear interpolation
        on their corresponding colors. Each color also has an alpha value. This dictates
        how visible this color will be in the final image. Try changing one of the
        colors in the Color Lookup Table.

      name: Compositing Methods
      description: 'All these samples'' colors colected along the ray need to be
        composited to create the final pixel color. There are 4 implemented compositing
        methods: Accumulate, Average, Maximum, and First. We will briefly explain
        each method'

    - identifier: 
      name: 'Compositing Methods: Accumulate'
      description: Accumulate adds up all sample colors. It also accumulates their
        opacity. When the accumulated opacity is more than the alpha cutoff value
        calculations are stopped. Note that when you change the sample distance the
        total opacity will also change. update the alpha value in your transfer function
        to correct for this.

    - identifier: 
      name: 'Compositing Methods: Average'
      description: Average takes the average of all the sample colors. It also takes
        the average opacity. So when you swich from accumulate to average you might
        want to change the alpha values in your transfer function to see more.

      name: 'Compositing Methods: First'
      description: 'First goes through the sample color untill one has an alpha value
        above the alpha cutoff value. As soon as it finds one sample above this cutoff
        it displays it as its final pixel color. This will give you the iso surface.

        In
        the preview we also added some lighting to increase depth perception.'

      description: If you select a specific ray you can see how the samples along
        the ray are used to calculate the final color. You will see the formulas
        of the compositing method and a sample by sample table of the composited
        color. Select a ray and view its calculations by clicking on a pixel in the
        Render Preview window.
